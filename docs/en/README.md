The Bill Splitter App is a useful tool to split the bill at restaurants or bars with friends and family. 
With this application, you can input the total amount of the bill, select the number of people who are
splitting the bill, and choose the percentage of tip you want to leave. The app will calculate the total
amount that each person should pay, including the tip, so that everyone can split the bill fairly and evenly.
